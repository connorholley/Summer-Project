# Summer-Project
The project will look at a large data set that has significant flyby. The goal of the project is to be able to group datasets positionally and temporally so that shared activities can eventually be identified. 

A good start could be to look at positional overlap within a certain time period. Whether the activity is shared can be figured out later.

Goals of this project:
1.Develop basic proficiency in C+
2.Further develop algorithm efficiency
3.Database Management
4.Improve professional skills with github
