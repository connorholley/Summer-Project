# Summer-Project
The project will look at a large data set that has significant flyby. The goal of the project is to be able to group datasets positionally and temporally so that shared activities can eventually be identified. 

A good start could be to look at positional overlap within a certain time period. Whether the activity is shared can be figured out later.

Goals of this project:
Develop basic proficiency in C+
Further develop algorithm efficiency
Database Management
Improve professional skills with github
