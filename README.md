# Summer-Project
The project will look at a large data set that has significant flyby. The goal of the project is to be able to group datasets positionally and temporally so that shared activities can eventually be identified. 

A good start could be to look at positional overlap within a certain time period. Whether the activity is shared can be figured out later.

As access to strava data has a few legal hurdles and I probably wouldn't be able to run enough to generate a large enough data set, some other sources should be explored. One such source that might be interesting would be the migratory patterns of different animals.
